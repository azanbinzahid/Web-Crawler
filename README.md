Tested on W10 and Ubuntu with Python3

How to run:


1. Compile and run 'crawler.py' with python3
2. Enter full site address when prompted or choose from options
5. My programme basically puts the url into a set (for no dublication) and recursively calls urls with same domain extracted from html parsing of <a> tags and hrefs.



My Wireshark on windows wasn't working. I had to install ubuntu on my machine. That's why I couldn't submit on time. Although my code for crawler was submitted on LMS.
