How to run:

1. Compile and run 'crawler.py' with python3
2. Enter full site address when prompted or choose from options
5. This programme basically puts the url into a set (for no dublication) and recursively calls urls with same domain extracted from html parsing of <a> tags and hrefs.
  
Tested on W10 and Ubuntu with Python3
